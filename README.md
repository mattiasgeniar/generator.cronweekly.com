# Example content

For some demo input material, look into the ```example.txt``` file, it contains the content of newsletter #49 to play around with.

For the intro text, use this:

> If you're reading this, it means the mailing list migration went as planned! If you aren't ... well ... something something schrödinger. :-)

> I took the time to tweak the layout a bit too, if it renders or looks weird on your device, send me a screenshot if you will. I'll whip out the old CSS skills and see what I can do.

> In the meanwhile: a diverse issue this time, lots of content. So grab a coffee, make yourself comfortable and enjoy reading!
